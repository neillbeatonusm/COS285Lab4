Q1.
This lab was about building and testing different search methods in a binary tree and learning how to use basic GitHub functionality and commands. It helped me understand recursion, how data moves through a tree, and how version control works. I struggled with using GitHub at first, especially committing and merging changes, but I eventually got it to work and learned a lot from the process. Overall, the lab went well and all my methods worked correctly in the end.
Q2.
Run the program by opening the terminal, navigating to the lab folder, and typing:
javac Lab4.java && java Lab4
