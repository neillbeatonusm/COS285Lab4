# COS285Lab4
i added a bredth method from lecture 9 and added a recursive method to search through the tree. This is the most infuriating assignment/lab i probably have ever had. the coding itself was simple but getting github and the terminal to operate is horrible.
cd "C:\Users\Kyle\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\COS285Lab4" javac lab4\*.java java -cp . lab4.Lab4 data.txt
